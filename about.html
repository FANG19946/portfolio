            <p>
                Hi, I’m Adnan Khan — a developer and AI enthusiast who enjoys turning ideas into real-world projects.
                I’m passionate about blending creativity with problem-solving and exploring how technology can create
                meaningful impact.
            </p>

            <p>
                I completed my undergraduate studies in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning at LNCT Bhopal and am
                now
                pursuing my Master’s at <strong>IIT Bombay</strong>.
                Along this journey, I earned an <strong>All India Rank of 36 in Data Analytics</strong> and <strong>143
                    in
                    Computer Science</strong> in GATE — milestones that reflect my dedication and love for the field.
            </p>

            <p>
                My long-term vision is to become a top expert in AI and to build products that combine technical depth
                with
                real-world value.
                Beyond academics and development, I’m endlessly curious — always looking to learn, explore new ideas,
                and
                challenge myself with meaningful projects.
            </p>
