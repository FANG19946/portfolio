                <h2>Frontend</h2>
                <p>
                    I specialize in building clean and interactive user interfaces with <strong>React</strong> and
                    <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>, ensuring both performance and design consistency. I also explore
                    <strong>React Three Fiber</strong> for 3D experiences and enjoy blending creativity with technology
                    to
                    make
                    visually engaging web applications.
                </p>

                <h2>Backend</h2>
                <p>
                    On the backend, I work primarily with <strong>Node.js</strong> and <strong>Express</strong> to build
                    robust,
                    scalable APIs. I focus on writing clean, maintainable code and creating systems that can handle
                    real-world
                    workloads. For AI pipelines, I also work with <strong>Flask</strong>, integrating machine learning
                    models
                    directly into applications.
                </p>

                <h2>Databases</h2>
                <p>
                    I’m experienced with <strong>MongoDB</strong> as my go-to database for flexible, document-based
                    storage.
                    Alongside it, I use <strong>Mongoose</strong> for schema design and queries. I’m also comfortable
                    working with
                    relational databases like <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> when projects call for structured data.
                </p>

                <h2>Languages</h2>
                <p>
                    My main programming languages are <strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>Python</strong>.
                    JavaScript
                    powers my
                    web development work, while Python is central to my AI and machine learning projects. I also have
                    working
                    knowledge of <strong>C++</strong> from my academic foundations, which helps with problem-solving and
                    efficiency.
                </p>

                <h2>AI & Machine Learning</h2>
                <p>
                    My background in AI includes working with <strong>Whisper</strong> for speech recognition,
                    <strong>IndicTrans</strong> for translation, <strong>Coqui TTS</strong> for text-to-speech, and
                    <strong>PyAnnote</strong> for speaker diarization. I also actively study <strong>transformer
                        architectures</strong> and large language models to deepen my understanding of how modern AI
                    systems
                    are built.
                </p>

                <h2>Tools & Workflow</h2>
                <p>
                    I use <strong>Git & GitHub</strong> for version control and collaboration, <strong>Docker</strong>
                    for
                    containerized development, and <strong>cloud GPU platforms</strong> like RunPod and LambdaLabs for
                    running
                    machine learning workloads. These tools allow me to move seamlessly from prototyping to production.
